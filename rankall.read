Ranking hospitals in all states


Write a function called rankall that takes two arguments: an outcome name (outcome) and a hospital ranking (num). The function reads the outcome-of-care-measures.csv file and returns a 2-column data frame
containing the hospital in each state that has the ranking specified in num. For example the function call
rankall("heart attack", "best") would return a data frame containing the names of the hospitals that
are the best in their respective states for 30-day heart attack death rates. The function should return a value
for every state (some may be NA). The first column in the data frame is named hospital, which contains
the hospital name, and the second column is named state, which contains the 2-character abbreviation for
the state name. Hospitals that do not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded from the set of
hospitals when deciding the rankings.
Handling ties. The rankall function should handle ties in the 30-day mortality rates in the same way
that the rankhospital function handles ties.

The function should use the following template.

rankall <- function(outcome, num = "best") {
## Read outcome data
## Check that state and outcome are valid
## For each state, find the hospital of the given rank
## Return a data frame with the hospital names and the
## (abbreviated) state name
}

NOTE: For the purpose of this part of the assignment (and for efficiency), your function should NOT call
the rankhospital function from the previous section.
The function should check the validity of its arguments. If an invalid outcome value is passed to rankall,
the function should throw an error via the stop function with the exact message “invalid outcome”. The num
variable can take values “best”, “worst”, or an integer indicating the ranking (smaller numbers are better).
If the number given by num is larger than the number of hospitals in that state, then the function should
return NA.

Here is some sample output from the function.
